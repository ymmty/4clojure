;Because Clojure's for macro allows you to "walk" over multiple sequences in a nested fashion, it is excellent for transforming all sorts of sequences. If you don't want a sequence ;as your final output (say you want a map), you are often still best-off using for, because you can produce a sequence and feed it into a map, for example.
;
;For this problem, your goal is to "flatten" a map of hashmaps. Each key in your output map should be the "path"1 that you would have to take in the original map to get to a value, ;so for example {1 {2 3}} should result in {[1 2] 3}. You only need to flatten one level of maps: if one of the values is a map, just leave it alone.

;1 That is, (get-in original [k1 k2]) should be the same as (get result [k1 k2])
